=================================================================
Go Port of [Johnny Five](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five)
=================================================================

This is a straight port of the Johnny Five project to the Go
Programming Language.

I took this on because:

    1. I like Go
    2. I like the Johnny Five Project
    3. -GoBots- GodeBots totally needs to be a thing (_gobots is already taken_)

Current Project Status:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Initial Implementation, nothing working yet
